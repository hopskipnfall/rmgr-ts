# RMG-K Replay File Format (`.rmgr`) — Specification

**Status:** format version `3`, implemented in `Source/RMG-Core/Replay.cpp` /
`Source/RMG-Core/ReplayMemory.cpp` on the `feature/replay-file-format` branch.

**Target game:** Super Smash Bros. (N64) — Smash Remix 2.0.1. The container
format itself (header framing, event stream mechanics) isn't game-specific,
and the header's `goodName`/`recorderSchemaVersion` (§3.3) exist precisely so
a future file for a different ROM/game is identifiable without guessing —
but the `GameStart`/`PostFrame` event field sets below are still
Smash-specific; a genuinely different game would need its own event
definitions, not just a different `goodName` value.

This document is the authoritative description of the on-disk byte layout.
If code and this document disagree, treat that as a bug — in either the code
or the document — and fix the mismatch rather than trusting one side blindly.

## 1. Overview

A `.rmgr` file is a self-contained binary recording of one N64 match: every
seated player's controller inputs, frame by frame, plus a snapshot of game
state (position, damage, stocks, action state, …) read directly from
emulated RAM. It is designed for two distinct consumers:

1. **Deterministic replay** — the recorded inputs are enough to re-simulate
   the match from scratch.
2. **Direct analysis** — the recorded game state is enough to build stats,
   visualizations, or search tooling *without* re-running the emulator at
   all.

The design is modeled on [Slippi's `.slp` format](https://github.com/project-slippi/slippi-wiki/blob/master/SPEC.md)
(Super Smash Bros. Melee / Dolphin) — a self-describing binary event stream —
but is **not** byte-compatible with it, and deliberately drops or changes
several of Slippi's choices. See §2.

## 2. Design goals and explicit non-goals

- **Streamed, not buffered.** A file is written incrementally, event by
  event, for the duration of a match — never built up in memory and flushed
  once at the end. A whole match's worth of per-frame data held in RAM is
  wasteful, and streaming means a crash mid-match still leaves a usable,
  truncated file on disk rather than nothing at all.
- **Self-describing, forward-compatible event stream, no schema compiler.**
  Every event is a 1-byte command code followed by a payload whose size was
  declared up front by the very first event in the file (`EventPayloads`,
  §4.1). A parser that doesn't recognize a command code can still skip it
  correctly and keep reading — the file can grow new event types or new
  trailing fields on existing events without breaking old parsers, and an
  old file's smaller payload sizes are exactly as valid to a new parser.
- **No FlatBuffers, no UBJSON, no schema-compiler toolchain.** FlatBuffers is
  built around finishing one complete buffer atomically; adapting it to a
  growing append-only stream means wrapping each event in its own
  independently-finished message, at which point most of its actual benefit
  (shared schema, zero-copy across a whole buffer) is gone and the per-message
  overhead (vtable, root offset) is a real cost against file size at 50-60
  events/sec. Slippi wraps its raw event stream in a UBJSON container
  (`{"raw": <binary>, "metadata": {...}}`) to embed a binary blob inside a
  JSON-like document; this format skips that problem entirely by not having
  a JSON-like document — the file *is* the binary event stream, with a small
  fixed binary header instead of a UBJSON wrapper.
- **Little-endian**, matching the host platforms this project targets
  (Linux/Windows, both little-endian in practice) — not Slippi's
  big-endian, which was a holdover from the GameCube/Wii's native PowerPC
  byte order and has no reason to carry over here. All multi-byte
  integer and float fields in this document are little-endian unless
  stated otherwise.
- **Native struct layout, no bit-packing.** Every event payload is a
  fixed-size, `#pragma pack(push, 1)` C struct with no padding and no
  bitfields — the byte layout tables below are exactly `sizeof()` that
  struct, field by field, in declaration order.

## 3. File structure

```
+----------------+----------------------------------------+
| File Header    | 88 bytes, fixed                         |
+----------------+----------------------------------------+
| Event Stream   | variable length, sequence of events      |
|                | (EventPayloads, then GameStart, then     |
|                | interleaved PreFrame/PostFrame per real   |
|                | frame, then GameEnd)                      |
+----------------+----------------------------------------+
```

There is no footer, no trailing metadata block, and no UBJSON/JSON wrapper
of any kind — the event stream *is* the rest of the file, up to
`streamLength` bytes (§3.1) after the header, or up to EOF for a file whose
recording session never cleanly finished.

### 3.1 File header (88 bytes)

| Offset | Size | Type       | Field                  | Notes                                                  |
|-------:|-----:|------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| 0x00   | 4    | `char[4]`  | `magic`                | Always the ASCII bytes `R`, `M`, `G`, `R` (no NUL).      |
| 0x04   | 1    | `u8`       | `version`               | Format version. `3` for everything described here.      |
| 0x05   | 3    | `u8[3]`    | `reserved`              | Always zero. Reserved for future header fields.          |
| 0x08   | 4    | `u32`      | `streamLength`          | Byte length of the event stream that follows the header. |
| 0x0C   | 64   | `char[64]` | `goodName`              | The recorded ROM's `GoodName` (mupen64plus-core's ROM database identity string), UTF-8, NUL-padded — not necessarily NUL-terminated if it fills the field. Truncated if longer than 64 bytes. |
| 0x4C   | 4    | `u32`      | `recorderSchemaVersion` | This recorder's revision of its own understanding of `goodName`'s memory layout — see §3.3. |
| 0x50   | 8    | `u64`      | `recordedAtEpochSeconds`| Wall-clock time the recording started, seconds since the Unix epoch (UTC) — what `time(nullptr)` returns. Independent of the filename's timestamp (§3.4), though the recorder writes the same instant to both. |

**`streamLength` is written as `0` when the file is opened**, and is the
*only* field patched after the fact: once the match ends (or is otherwise
finalized), the recorder seeks back to offset `0x08` and writes the real
length, then closes the file. This is a direct crash-safety trick: a reader
can tell "was this file's recording session ever cleanly finished" just by
checking whether `streamLength` is nonzero, and a file left at `streamLength
== 0` (the process died, or the emulator was killed, mid-match) is still a
valid, parseable, truncated recording — a reader should fall back to reading
events until EOF instead of trusting the header's length in that case.

### 3.2 Event stream

A sequence of events, back to back, no padding between them:

```
+------+----------------------------+
| 1B   | command code               |
+------+----------------------------+
| N B  | payload (N declared by      |
|      | the EventPayloads event)   |
+------+----------------------------+
```

The very first event in every file is always `EventPayloads` (`0x01`, §4.1).
Every subsequent event is one of `GameStart` (`0x02`, once, immediately
after `EventPayloads`), `PreFrameUpdate` (`0x03`), `PostFrameUpdate`
(`0x04`), or `GameEnd` (`0x05`, once, at the very end — present only if the
recording session finished cleanly).

For each real emulated frame that the match is actively ongoing
(`game_status == 1`, see §7.5) and has at least one seated port, the
recorder writes one `PreFrameUpdate` immediately followed by one
`PostFrameUpdate` for each seated port, ports visited in ascending order
(0, 1, 2, 3) — i.e. for a 2-player match on ports 0 and 1, frame N looks
like `Pre(port 0), Post(port 0), Pre(port 1), Post(port 1)`. Ports that are
empty or unseated that frame have no events at all — never a zeroed/dummy
event — so a reader must not assume every frame has all four ports present,
and must not assume a fixed number of events per frame.

### 3.3 `goodName` and `recorderSchemaVersion` — two independent axes

These two fields exist to answer two different questions, and conflating
them is the mistake to avoid:

- **`goodName`** identifies *which ROM build* produced the file — a unique
  identity, not a family. `SmashRemix2.0.1` and a hypothetical
  `SmashRemix2.0.2` are different `goodName`s even though they're the "same"
  mod, because their memory layouts can differ.
- **`recorderSchemaVersion`** identifies *which revision of this recorder's
  interpretation* of that specific `goodName`'s memory layout produced the
  file. It's bumped whenever that interpretation changes in a way that
  affects recorded output — which includes but isn't limited to adding a new
  field. A fix to an *existing* field's offset (silently changing recorded
  *values* without changing any event's declared byte size) needs a bump
  too, since the per-event `EventPayloads` declared-size mechanism (§5) has
  no way to signal that on its own.

`recorderSchemaVersion` is its own counter **per `goodName`**, not global:
`SmashRemix2.0.1` schema `3` and `SmashRemix2.0.2` schema `1` are unrelated
numbering spaces, each starting fresh at `1` for that `goodName`'s first
supported revision.

A reader that only knows how to interpret one specific `(goodName,
recorderSchemaVersion)` pair should check both explicitly before trusting
any event payload's semantics, rather than assuming every file it can parse
was produced by the same game and recorder revision it was built against.

### 3.4 Filename convention

Not part of the on-disk format itself (a reader must not depend on it — the
header's own `recordedAtEpochSeconds` is the source of truth for when a
recording started, precisely because filenames get renamed/copied/re-shared
and can't be trusted), but the recorder names files
`YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS[-Player1][-Player2]...rmgr` — 4-digit year, 24-hour clock,
local time, one hyphen-joined segment per seated player's name (each capped
at 24 characters, filesystem-unsafe characters replaced with `_`). The
timestamp reflects the same instant written to `recordedAtEpochSeconds`,
just rendered as local wall-clock time instead of a UTC epoch value.

If that name is already taken (e.g. two matches recorded within the same
second), the recorder appends `-2`, `-3`, ... before the extension until it
finds a free name, rather than overwriting an existing file.

Headless export of an existing `.krec` (see `Replay::SetOutputPathOverride()`)
uses a different, caller-chosen base name instead - by convention
`<krec name>.rmgr`, the same stem as the source `.krec` it was exported from,
so the two plainly correspond by name. Each match within that `.krec` gets
its own explicitly-numbered file from that base: `<krec name>-1.rmgr`,
`<krec name>-2.rmgr`, ... (not just `<krec name>.rmgr` for the first match).
The same collision-avoidance above still applies on top, e.g. if the same
`.krec` is exported a second time.

## 4. Events

### 4.1 Event Payloads — code `0x01`

Always the first event in the file. Declares the exact payload size (not
including the 1-byte command code) of every other event type this file
uses. This is the entire forward-compatibility mechanism: a parser that
doesn't recognize a command code looks it up here and skips exactly that
many bytes, rather than guessing or breaking.

| Offset | Size    | Type      | Field         | Notes                                          |
|-------:|--------:|-----------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 0x00   | 1       | `u8`      | `count`       | Number of `(code, size)` entries that follow.    |
| 0x01   | 3×count | see below | `entries`     | `count` repetitions of the 3-byte entry below.   |

Each entry:

| Offset (rel.) | Size | Type  | Field  | Notes                                    |
|---------------:|-----:|-------|--------|-------------------------------------------|
| +0x00          | 1    | `u8`  | `code` | The event command code this entry describes. |
| +0x01          | 2    | `u16` | `size` | That event's payload size, in bytes.      |

v1 always declares exactly 4 entries, in this order: `GameStart`,
`PreFrameUpdate`, `PostFrameUpdate`, `GameEnd` — currently sized 164, 9, 42,
and 5 bytes respectively (`GameStart` grew from its original 150 bytes via
the field-append mechanism in §5; see §4.2's note on that). A future format
version could declare more entries (new event types) or the same entries
with even larger sizes (more fields appended to an existing event) — see
§5. **A parser must always read an event's size from that file's own
`EventPayloads` event, never hardcode it** — this is exactly why.

### 4.2 Game Start — code `0x02`

Written exactly once, immediately after `EventPayloads`. Everything static
for the whole match — nothing here changes frame to frame. **Player display
names are sourced from netplay room metadata (RMG-K's own slot-indexed name
table, populated by every netplay path), never from Smash Remix's in-game
name tags** — for an offline match, or a port with no assigned name, the
corresponding `playerNames` entry is all zero bytes.

Payload size: **164 bytes.**

| Offset | Size | Type      | Field                | Notes                                                    |
|-------:|-----:|-----------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0x00   | 1    | `u8`      | `stageId`             | See §7.2.                                                  |
| 0x01   | 1    | `u8`      | `gameType`             | `1` time, `2` stock, `3` both (Remix always forces stock). |
| 0x02   | 1    | `u8`      | `stockCountSetting`    | 0-based (i.e. `2` means "3 stocks").                       |
| 0x03   | 1    | `u8`      | `timeLimitMinutes`     | `100` = infinite.                                          |
| 0x04   | 1    | `u8`      | `damageRatio`          | `50` = 50%, `200` = 200%.                                  |
| 0x05   | 1    | `u8`      | `itemFrequency`        | `0` none .. `5` high.                                      |
| 0x06   | 16   | struct[4] | `ports`                | 4× the 4-byte `PortSettings` struct below, port 0-3 in order. |
| 0x16   | 128  | char[4][32]| `playerNames`         | 4× a 32-byte, NUL-padded (not necessarily NUL-terminated if exactly 32 chars) name string, port 0-3 in order. |
| 0x96   | 1    | `u8`      | `teamsEnabled`         | `0` off, `1` on. **Appended field** — see the note below the table. |
| 0x97   | 1    | `u8`      | `handicapMode`         | `0` off, `1` on, `2` auto.                                 |
| 0x98   | 4    | `u8[4]`   | `portTeam`             | Team number per port, index = port 0-3.                    |
| 0x9C   | 4    | `u8[4]`   | `portHandicap`         | Per-port handicap value, meaningful only when `handicapMode != 0`. |
| 0xA0   | 4    | `u8[4]`   | `portCpuLevel`         | CPU difficulty per port; meaningless for a `human` port.    |

**`teamsEnabled` through `portCpuLevel` (offsets `0x96`-`0xA3`) were appended
after the original v1 fields** (`stageId` through `playerNames`, offsets
`0x00`-`0x95`, unchanged since the format's first version) — per §5's
field-addition rule, this is why they sit after `playerNames` rather than
next to the other match-wide settings at the top of the struct. The four
`port*` arrays require the same player-object/player-struct pointer chase
as Post-Frame Update (§4.4); if a ReadPortMatchInfo/ReadPortPlayerState open
finds a port's characters not yet spawned (e.g. `GameStart` was written
during the pre-match countdown, before `game_status` reaches `1`), that
port's `portTeam`/`portHandicap`/`portCpuLevel` entries are left at `0`
rather than the real value — a reader can't distinguish "genuinely 0" from
"not available yet" for these three fields alone.

`PortSettings` (4 bytes, repeated 4× inline above at offset `0x06` — **not**
a separately declared event, just a fixed sub-layout within `GameStart`,
and distinct from the appended `portTeam`/`portHandicap`/`portCpuLevel`
arrays above):

| Offset (rel.) | Size | Type | Field         | Notes                              |
|---------------:|-----:|------|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| +0x00          | 1    | `u8` | `slotType`     | `0` human, `1` CPU, `2` empty.       |
| +0x01          | 1    | `u8` | `characterId`  | See §7.1. Meaningless if `slotType == 2`. |
| +0x02          | 1    | `u8` | `costumeId`    |                                        |
| +0x03          | 1    | `u8` | `teamColor`    |                                        |

### 4.3 Pre-Frame Update — code `0x03`

Input-side data, captured **before** the game processes that frame's inputs.
One event per seated port per frame (§3.2). Uses the game's already-processed
button/stick values (`playerStruct+0x1BC/+0x1C2/+0x1C3` — see
`Source/RMG-Core/ReplayMemory.cpp`), which is the one input representation
available uniformly for **both** human and CPU-controlled ports; the raw
physical-controller struct (`+0x1B0`) is human-ports-only and is not
recorded.

Payload size: **9 bytes.**

| Offset | Size | Type   | Field     | Notes                                                        |
|-------:|-----:|--------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0x00   | 4    | `i32`  | `frame`   | Frame counter, `0` at the first frame this match's recording enters the "ongoing" game state (`game_status == 1`). Monotonically increasing, one recorded frame per real emulated frame. |
| 0x04   | 1    | `u8`   | `port`    | `0`-`3`.                                                        |
| 0x05   | 2    | `u16`  | `buttons` | Processed button bitmask. See §7.4.                             |
| 0x07   | 1    | `i8`   | `stickX`  | Processed stick X, signed.                                      |
| 0x08   | 1    | `i8`   | `stickY`  | Processed stick Y, signed.                                      |

### 4.4 Post-Frame Update — code `0x04`

State-side data, captured **after** that frame's physics/collision
resolution — the resulting state. One event per seated port per frame,
always immediately following that port's `PreFrameUpdate` in the stream.

Payload size: **50 bytes.**

| Offset | Size | Type   | Field                | Notes                                                            |
|-------:|-----:|--------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0x00   | 4    | `i32`  | `frame`                | Same frame counter as the paired `PreFrameUpdate`.                   |
| 0x04   | 1    | `u8`   | `port`                 | `0`-`3`.                                                              |
| 0x05   | 1    | `u8`   | `characterId`           | See §7.1.                                                             |

| 0x0C   | 4    | `f32`  | `positionY`             |                                                                        |
| 0x10   | 4    | `i32`  | `facingDirection`       | `1` = facing right, `-1` = facing left. (Integer in this game, not a float like Slippi's Melee-derived field.) |
| 0x14   | 4    | `f32`  | `velocityX`             |                                                                        |

| 0x1C   | 4    | `u32`  | `damagePercent`         | Whole-number percent, as the game itself stores it (not a float).     |
| 0x20   | 1    | `i8`   | `stocksRemaining`       | 0-based; negative once eliminated.                                    |

| 0x22   | 1    | `u8`   | `groundedState`         | `0` grounded, `1` airborne.                                           |
| 0x23   | 1    | `u8`   | `hurtboxState`          | `0x03` = intangible/invincible; see `ReplayMemory.cpp` for the full set observed. |
| 0x24   | 2    | `u16`  | `hitstunCounter`        | Non-zero while in hitstun.                                            |
| 0x26   | 4    | `u32`  | `actionFrameCounter`    | Frame counter of the current action state (resets when the action state changes). |
| 0x2A   | 4    | `u32`  | `comboHitCount`         | v1 field-append (§5). Native engine combo counter, not mod-added - tracked even with the in-game combo meter display off. Belongs to the *victim* (this port), not the attacker: hits taken in the current unbroken chain. `0` = no active chain, `1` = a single hit (not yet a "combo" by convention), `2+` = an actual combo. Zeroes the instant the chain breaks - Smash Remix extends what counts as "unbroken" to survive grabs/wall-bounces/tech-chases, which vanilla would reset. Source: smashremix `docs/ram-map.md` §13. |
| 0x2E   | 4    | `u32`  | `comboDamage`           | v1 field-append (§5). Running damage dealt within the same chain as `comboHitCount`; zeroes at the same instant. |

### 4.5 Game End — code `0x05`

Written exactly once, at the very end of a cleanly-finished recording
session, immediately before the header's `streamLength` is patched. **A
truncated file (crash, force-quit) has no `GameEnd` event at all** — its
absence, together with `streamLength == 0`, is how a reader distinguishes
an incomplete recording from a genuinely short match.

Payload size: **5 bytes.**

| Offset | Size | Type    | Field          | Notes                                                                 |
|-------:|-----:|---------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0x00   | 1    | `u8`    | `endReason`     | `0` aborted (match reset, or the emulator/process stopped mid-match — these two causes are not currently distinguished), `1` normal end. |
| 0x01   | 4    | `i8[4]` | `placements`    | Final stocks remaining, per port 0-3. `-1` for any port that was never seated. |

## 5. Versioning and forward compatibility

Two independent mechanisms, matching §4.6 of the original design rationale:

- **Field additions to an existing event:** always append new fields to the
  *end* of that event's payload, never insert in the middle. An old parser
  — which learned the event's size from that file's own `EventPayloads`
  event, which will correctly declare the *old*, smaller size for an old
  file — simply never reads the new trailing bytes. A new parser reading an
  old file sees the old, smaller declared size in that file's own
  `EventPayloads` event and correctly knows not to read fields that were
  never written.
- **New event types:** an old parser encountering a command code it doesn't
  recognize looks up its declared size in `EventPayloads` and skips exactly
  that many bytes, then continues from the next event.

`FileHeader.version` (currently `3`) is reserved for a breaking change to
the *header* or the overall framing itself — not for anything the two
mechanisms above already cover, and not for tracking which game/ROM
produced a file or how that recorder's understanding of it has evolved
either — that's `goodName`/`recorderSchemaVersion` (§3.3), a deliberately
separate axis from the container format itself.

**Compatibility note:** `version` jumped `1` → `2` (adding `goodName` and
`recorderSchemaVersion`) → `3` (adding `recordedAtEpochSeconds`), each a
breaking change to files already recorded under the prior version (they
lack those fields entirely, at a different header size) — accepted
deliberately both times, since no file predating this spec's current form
has any external consumer yet. A `version 1` or `version 2` file is not
expected to parse under this spec.

## 6. Byte order and encoding

Everything in this file — the header and every event payload — is
**little-endian**. There is no manual byte-swapping anywhere in the
reference implementation: values are read directly from emulated memory via
`DebugMemRead8/16/32` (which already normalize to host byte order) and
written to disk as raw native-layout structs on little-endian host
platforms.

Floats are IEEE-754 single precision (32-bit), stored as the exact bit
pattern the game itself holds in memory — reinterpret the 4 bytes as a
`float`/`f32`, don't scale or convert.

Strings (`playerNames` in `GameStart`) are fixed-width byte arrays,
NUL-padded, **not necessarily NUL-terminated** if the name fills the full
field width — always read up to the declared field width and trim trailing
NULs, never scan for a terminator past the field boundary.

Derived predicates a consumer may find useful: dead/being-KO'd =
`actionStateId <= 0x004`; respawning = `actionStateId == 0x005` or
`0x007`-`0x009`; in hitstun = `actionStateId` in `0x025`-`0x039` (or check
`hitstunCounter` directly, §4.4); shielding = `actionStateId` in
`0x098`-`0x09B`; grabbed = `actionStateId` in `0x0AB`-`0x0BC`; attacking =
`actionStateId >= 0x0BE`. Airborne state should come from `groundedState`
(§4.4), not be inferred from `actionStateId` alone.

### 7.4 Controller button bits (`PreFrameUpdate.buttons`)

```
0x8000 A       0x0400 D-Down   0x0020 L

0x0800 D-Up                    0x0001 C-Right
```

### 7.5 `game_status` (internal, not directly exposed as an event field)

Governs the recorder's own state machine (not written to the file directly,
but explains the `frame` counter's start point and `GameEnd.endReason`):
`0` pre-match countdown, `1` ongoing (this is the only state that produces
`PreFrameUpdate`/`PostFrameUpdate` events, and `frame == 0` is the first
frame this state is observed), `2` paused, `5` ended.

## 8. Known limitations / not yet implemented

These are deliberate v1 scope cuts, not oversights — later format versions
can add any of them as new event types or appended fields per §5, without
breaking existing files or parsers:

- **No item tracking.** No `ItemUpdate`-equivalent event exists; N64 Smash
  item/projectile memory offsets have not been mapped.
- **No RNG/desync-detection event.** No `FrameStart`-equivalent event (RNG
  seed, internal scene frame counter); no known Smash Remix RNG seed address
  has been identified.
- **No aggregate damage-dealt/taken breakdown, no shield-damage, no
  incoming-damage-this-hit field**, even though the emulator exposes them —
  deferred as not essential for a first version.
- **`GameEnd.endReason` cannot currently distinguish time-out from
  stock-out** — both collapse to `1` ("normal end"); only "aborted vs. not"
  is currently derivable from available memory.
- **Character-specific action states (`>= 0x0DC`) have no shared table** —
  meaning is entirely per-character and would need to be derived
  empirically per character if finer-grained special-move detection is
  wanted.
- **Remix-specific stage IDs (`0x29`+) are not enumerated** in §7.2 — would
  need re-deriving from the mod's assembly source.
- **No ROM-identity check.** The recorder does not verify the loaded ROM is
  actually Smash Remix before recording; enabling the feature on a
  different game will produce a `.rmgr` file with garbage bytes (it does not
  crash — the pointer-validity checks in `ReplayMemory.cpp` cause it to stay
  in "waiting for a match" indefinitely rather than write nonsense, in the
  overwhelming majority of cases, but this is not a guarantee).

## 9. Reference implementation

- **Writer:** `Source/RMG-Core/Replay.cpp` / `Source/RMG-Core/Replay.hpp`
  (C++, streamed, single writer instance per emulation session).
- **Memory reader:** `Source/RMG-Core/ReplayMemory.cpp` /
  `Source/RMG-Core/ReplayMemory.hpp` (the N64 RAM pointer-chase that feeds
  the writer above; not part of the file format itself, but the source of
  truth for every field's semantics).
- **TypeScript reader/writer + tests:** [`rmgr-ts/`](../rmgr-ts/) at the
  repository root — a standalone package (no dependency on the C++ build)
  intended to be extracted into its own repository. See
  [`rmgr-ts/README.md`](../rmgr-ts/README.md) for its API.
